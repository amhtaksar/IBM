# Serial Number Extraction

Given an image of a device, extract the serial number. The presented solution was to approach the problem on two fronts. The first front was to get only the pixels needed for the serial numner. A more robust implementation may look at pattern matching to find the specific area containing the serial number. However the second front was to approach the problem through user experience - have the user tell the application where the serial number will be located in the source image.
